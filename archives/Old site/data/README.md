# data formatting

# SIMPLE (1 image, 1 description)

# COMPLICATED (1-3 images, 1-3 description)

# COMPLEX (5 images, 5 description)

this is unnecessary since the function takes every key so number of images and description isn't a problem 
its best to organize them based on what the data is about.
